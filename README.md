# simulation-module-3

### First laboratory
Application "Tell me 'yes' or 'no'"

### Second laboratory
"Orb of prediction" (or "Magic 8-Ball") 

### Third laboratory
* Implement algorithm of events simulation based on the given probabilities
* Implement gathering of statistics of the events simulation
* Analyze dependence of accuracy of the result on the number of trials (N = 10, 100, 1000, 10000)

### Fourth laboratory
* Implement an algorithm for conducting a series of experiments to simulate a discrete random variable specified by the distribution
* Calculate empirical probabilities, sample mean and variance, their relative errors
* Calculate the chi-squared statistic and apply the chi-squared test for different values of N (N = 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000)
* Draw a conclusion

### Fifth laboratory
Use Poisson distribution for the number of goals in a match

### Sixth laboratory
Simulate normal RV using any method. 
Perform statistics processing of the results:
* Build histogram; 
* Estimate accuracy (relative errors, chi-squared test) for sample size equal to 10, 100, 1000, 10000;
* Draw a conclusion.
